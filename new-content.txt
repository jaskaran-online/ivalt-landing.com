iVALT – Identity Validation Platform®

Authenticate Anywhere® & ANYONE

1. The Identity Crisis
    - Legacy identity methods—passwords, basic 2FA, device certificates—are failing. Roughly 50% of cyberattacks start with stolen credentials.
    - Emerging risks:
        - Cybercrime costs projected at $10.5 trillion annually by 2025
        - IoT devices now outnumber humans, often with poor security
        - AI deepfakes & social engineering attacks are exploding
        - Lack of endpoint identity for humans, IoT, and AI agents is a root cause of breaches
        - iVALT delivers a revolutionary platform for verified trust across all digital interactions — without passwords.

2. iVALT Identity Validation Platform®
    - Existing identity solutions are fragmented, complex, and fail to establish true identity at the endpoint—especially for IoT and AI agents.
    - iVALT offers a single, unified platform for validating the identity of humans, IoT devices, and AI agents.
    2.1 Human Authentication: Mobile-Centric
        - No usernames/passwords — mobile number as secure ID
        - Multi-Factor (up to 25) Authentication:
          - Biometrics: Face, fingerprint
          - Device identity: Registered phone
          - GPS & Time: Real-world context
          - Dynamic Variables: Real-time random data (weather, stocks, etc.)
          - AI-driven factor selection
        - Result: Dynamic, context-aware authentication that is nearly impossible to hack, even by AI.
    2.2 IoT & AI Agent Identification
        - Creator ID / Instance ID
        - Time of creation
        - TOTP (Time-based One Time Password)
        - Expected network origin
        - Dynamic variables
3. Key Applications (Initial Focus)
    - DocuID™ – Secure Document Access Control
      - Authors embed authorized recipients (via mobile #) in encrypted documents.
      - Recipients verify identity via multi-factor authentication.
      - Full Digital Rights Management (DRM): prevents forwarding, printing, screenshots.
    - On-Demand ID™ – Combatting Social Engineering & Deepfakes
        - Real-time identity verification within our mobile app.
        - Instantly verify the identity of suspicious calls/messages via biometrics & location.
        - The only solution worldwide to truly defeat deepfake & social engineering attacks.
    - Universal Biometric ID® – Enterprise Security
        - Enhances corporate Identity and Access Management (IAM).
        - When an employee logs in, iVALT “pings” their mobile for real-time biometric and contextual verification.
        - Makes stolen passwords useless.

4. Vision: Future Applications
iVALT’s platform is extensible beyond the initial three applications—designed for future-proof identity validation across emerging AI, IoT, and human interaction scenarios.
