                                       This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how iVALT, Inc. and its related companies (“Company”) collect, use and share personal information of users in the use of its WordPress plug-in and authentication services.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>WHAT WE COLLECT</h3>
                                    <p class="text-normal text-justify ">
                                       The Company may collect information about you in several ways.<br/>
                                       Information You Give Us. The Company may collect your name, email address, website URL and mobile phone number, as well as any other information you directly give us in the course of using our plug-in and services. This information may be collected from the Company’s WordPress plug-in or through registering and enrolling on the associated mobile application made available by the Company.<br/>
                                       Information We Collect from Our Mobile Application. The Company collects your mobile number and facial profile information on the Company’s mobile application you download in the course of setting up the WordPress authentication services. This information is collected separately from WordPress and is stored on your mobile phone. The Company collects and/or store biometrics information on the user’s mobile phone.<br/>
                                       Therefore, we collect two types of data, i.e., metadata for the user and the encoded data of the user’s face. The user metadata is stored in our Server in encrypted manner. The face data is stored on the user’s mobile phone. The metadata is stored indefinitely unless the user explicitly asks us via email to remove it from our server.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>MISCELLANEOUS</h3>
                                    <ul style="    list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                                       <li>This EULA is governed by the laws of the State of Illinois, United States of America.</li>
                                       <li>NO WARRANTIES. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Distributor expressly disclaims any warranty for the SOFTWARE. The SOFTWARE and any related documentation are provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk arising out of use or performance of the SOFTWARE remains with you.</li>
                                       <li>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Distributor’s entire liability and your exclusive remedy under this EULA shall not exceed the purchase price of the SOFTWARE.</li>
                                       <li>NO LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Distributor or its licensors be liable for any damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business profit, business interruption, loss of business information, or any other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of, or inability to use, the SOFTWARE, even if Distributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Because some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply to you.</li>
                                       <li>INJUNCTION. Because Distributor would be irreparably damaged if the terms and conditions of the EULA were not specifically enforced, you agree that Distributor shall be entitled, without bond, other security or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with respect to breaches of this EULA, in addition to such other remedies as Distributor may otherwise have under applicable laws.</li>
                                       <li>INDEMNITY. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Distributor, its licensors, partners, affiliates, contractors, officers, directors, employees and agents harmless from all damages, losses and expenses arising directly or indirectly from your acts and omissions to act in using the SOFTWARE pursuant to the terms of this EULA.</li>
                                       <li>U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS. The software and documentation have been developed entirely at private expense and are provided as “Commercial Computer Software” or “restricted computer software.” Use, duplication or disclosure by the U.S. Government or a U.S. Government sub-contractor is subject to the restrictions set forth in subparagraph (c) (1) (ii) of the Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software clauses in DFARS 252.227-7013 or as set forth in subparagraph (c)(1) and (2) of the Commercial Computer Software Restricted Rights clauses at FAR 52.227-19, as applicable. The Contractor/Manufacturer is [DISTRIBUTOR’S NAME AND ADDRESS].</li>
