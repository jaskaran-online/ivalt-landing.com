            Pleasanton, Calif.—January 10, 2025:
          </strong>{" "}
          Psono, a leader in secure password management using end-to-end
          encryption, chose iVALT to dramatically upgrade digital security using
          iVALT&apos;s biometric and industry-leading 5 factor authentication
          (5FA). The collaboration offers an advanced ultra secure way to combat
          cyber threats. Integrating iVALT&apos;s unique 5FA system into
          Psono&apos;s enterprise-grade platform.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6 text-justify">
          While most of us are familiar with Two-factor authentication (2FA) it
          is clear that this system has vulnerabilities. 2FA offers limited
          deterrence against hackers who can bypass its protections through
          methods like phishing, SIM cloning, or social engineering attacks.
          2FA&apos;s device-centric approach creates a system that still has
          major vulnerabilities since it focuses on authenticating devices
          rather than a user&apos;s identity. iVALT changes that.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-primary mb-4">
          iVALT&apos;s 5-Factor Authentication
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          iVALT offers the most secure identity management in the world by
          providing 5FA which focuses on identifying the user identity vs.
          authenticating a device. This major distinction separates iValt from
          all competition as users are identified in 5 different ways:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-justify">
          <li>
            Mobile Biometric Verification for unique identity confirmation.
          </li>
          <li>Device Registration to link access to specific devices.</li>
          <li>GPS Geofencing to restrict authentication by location.</li>
          <li>
            Time Windows to limit and create custom access periods for each
            user.
          </li>
          <li>Dynamic User Variables for tailored security.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-6 text-justify">
          iValt&apos;s fully integrated solution is designed to offer businesses
          and individuals unprecedented levels of security by minimizing the
          risks associated with compromised credentials and unauthorized access.
          The company&apos;s collaboration with Psono offers a security solution
          that will add 5FA to Psono&apos;s password management giving Psono the
          most advanced identity management available.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6 text-justify">
          &quot;Our 5FA system was designed to address vulnerabilities beyond
          traditional methods,&quot; says iVALT CEO & Co-Founder, Baldev
          Krishan, Ph.D. &quot;Ransomware, social engineering, deepfakes and
          phishing are out of control and will only increase in volume and
          velocity. By applying 5FA to Psono&apos;s, password management system,
          we&apos;re setting a new standard for trust in digital security.&quot;
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6 text-justify">
          It&apos;s a perspective that&apos;s echoed by Sascha Pfeiffer, CEO of
          Psono. &quot;We&apos;ve always believed that security should be
          uncompromising yet user-friendly. Partnering with iVALT allows us to
          bring next-generation authentication to our customers, making their
          digital experiences both safer and seamless.&quot;
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6 text-justify">
          A welcome solution that&apos;s going to make us all much safer online,
          the iVALT app is easy to use, takes only three minutes to register,
          and is available to download now from the App Store or Google Play.
