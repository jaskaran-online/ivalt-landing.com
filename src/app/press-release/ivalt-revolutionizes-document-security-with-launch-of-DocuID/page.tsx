          iVALT, an innovator in identity verification and security solutions,
          today announced the launch of{" "}
          <strong className="text-navy-primary">DocuID</strong>, a
          groundbreaking document protection service that empowers document
          owners with unprecedented control over access to their critical
          information. DocuID utilizes a unique 1-click mobile-centric approach,
          embedding authorized user credentials directly into encrypted
          documents and leveraging iVALT&apos;s advanced 5+ factor identity
          verification system to grant access, ensuring that only approved users
          can open and read the document. In addition, any document secured by
          DocuID cannot be opened if forwarded to an unapproved user.

        <p className="mb-6 text-justify">
          In today&apos;s digital landscape, ensuring the confidentiality and
          integrity of sensitive documents is paramount. Traditional security
          measures often fall short, leaving valuable information vulnerable to
          unauthorized access. DocuID addresses this critical need by offering a
          revolutionary solution that combines robust encryption with granular
          access control, all managed seamlessly through a user&apos;s mobile
          device.
